# JavaScript Zipcode Finder

A simple web app that allows users to search for US Zipcodes using the <a href="http://www.zippopotam.us/">Zippopotam.us</a> API. If the user enters a valid zip, the city name, state, longitude and latitude will appear on the DOM. If an invalid zip is entered, an error message will appear. All functionality was written in vanilla JavaScript and the Bulma CSS framework was used for styling.

To run the app, run `index.html` on any kind of server. No API key is required to access Zippopotam's API.

I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3GfUH7AZKs">this tutorial</a> for this project.
